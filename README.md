## Project Goals, Scope & Purpose
The goal of the project is to preserve a part of US corporate history. Enron was, at a time, the largest trader of natural gas and electricity and one of the largest companies in the US overall. It was named 'Most Innovative Company' by Fortune for 6 consecutive years and the company pioneered several industries and trading markets.

The scope of the project is to preserve Enron's internet presence as it was on or before August 13th, 2001 - the resignation date of Jeff Skilling. The scope of the project doesn't include events after that date and certanly doesn't include events after bankrupcty and later legal proceedings. There are plenty of other projects that preserve such information.

The purpose of the project - and the Enron Archive as a whole - is to present information about the company and its activities. Most online information about Enron focuses on its bankrupcty and later events, and there is little online footprint of its activities beforehand.
